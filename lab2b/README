My graph is first.png and second.png

my program correctly work with the option in spec.

Answer to the question at below

QUESTION 2B.1A:
Explain the variation in time per operation vs the number of iterations?
The time oer operations drops as the number of iterations grow.(at first)
It is because of the overhead of creating threads effect the per operation time at first.
the per operation will increase as number of iteration increase at late time becuase the time complexcity grow 
as linear O(n) for the list insertion.The time per operation will increase as number of iteration increase at late time.
(since n is increase with iteration)


QUESTION 2B.1B:
How would you propose to correct for this effect?
To fix the effect we need to elimate the inseration linear time complecity grow.
We can simple divide the total time by number of nodes in list which is close to iteration*threads.
It will give us the correct time for our graph in graph2.
QUESTIONS 2B.2A:
Compare the variation in time per protected operation vs the number of threads in Project 2B and in Project 2A.  Explain the difference.
1. the lab2b(list)'s critical resource is much greater than lab2a (add)'s critical resource.
2.the clock is held for a longer time in lab2b than lab2a.
3.probability of conflict in list is much higher than lab2a for the same number of threads. 
4. Lab2b has more conflicts, more blocked threads,more over head,and less parallilism.
