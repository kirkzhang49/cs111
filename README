My make check was testing with single --input=test1.txt,single --output=test2.txt and both
use diff test1.txt test2.txt to check if the two files are the same.
Also I test for --catch only and --input=test1.txt --output=test2.txt  --segfault --catch
My test case will stop when get segfault.
I use GDB to run my lab0 and make two pictures of them.
my make build the lab0 correctly,and make clean clean the files back to orignal state.
my lab0 correctly work with --input --output for both large and small files
it exit and display error message when input with a unreadble file and output with a unreadble file or report for nonexist 
input file.
work for --segfault and --catch and both
