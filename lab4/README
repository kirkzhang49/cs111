QA-2
Examine the output, see what is being sent to the server. Write a brief description of 
what you see and how this relates to the security goals of this system, and include it in your lab submission.
I see the message of rate:3 (the speed of message)range:4 (variation of heartbeat) 
It sending the Heart rate message of patient to the server 
It received the Heart rate message of patient from the server, and print.
It is pseudorandomly. Since UDP does not encrypt traffic- the data is sent out over the wireless medium is 
in Plain text. And the message here is not safe which can be stolen by someone executing the packet inspector.

QA-4
Explain the output of the packet sniffer and why this is important
It contains the exchange information,and the message string.
It is important because the packet sniffer is the unknown sniffer follow by 
plain text of heart rate string, it is important because this packet sniffer 
stolen the heart rate string been sent.

QA-5(b)
Comment on how your “./udp_client” reacts and take a screenshot of the output
the udp_client recive a message New rate 5 received from server.
and the rate of Current setting change to 5 and the speed of message changed.

QA-5(d)
Explain the output of the packet sniffer and why this is important
It contains the exchange information,and the message string.
It is important because the packet sniffer is the unknown sniffer follow by 
plain text of heart rate string, it is important because this packet sniffer 
stolen the heart rate string been sent.

QA-6(b)
Comment on how your “./udp_client” reacts and take a screenshot of the output
after attack
the udp_client recive a message New rate 15 received from server.
and the rate of Current setting change to 15 and the speed of message changed.(slow)

QA-6(d)
Explain the output of the packet sniffer and why this is important
It contains the exchange information,and the message string.
It is important because the packet sniffer is the unknown sniffer follow by 
plain text of heart rate string, it is important because this packet sniffer 
stolen the heart rate string been sent.

QB-4
Examine the output, see what is being sent to the server. Include an analysis of this
output in your lab submission.

it is very smilar message as QA-2
but with two more messages Client-Server connection complete with AES256-SHA encryption
Server Certificate Descriptor:
Then it print mostly similar message as UDP,but this time it is encrypt by TLS which make our 
heart rate message become safter.

QB-5
Explain the output of the packet sniffer and why this is important
The sniffer here is very similar to QA-4 but with the plain text of heart rate string here
is encrypted by the TLS.
so the heart rate is not be stolen here.

QB-6(b)
Comment on how your “./tls_client” reacts and take a screenshot of the output
the tls_client receive a message New rate 1 received from server.
and the current setting chaged to 1 and speed of message changed
Also the set rate cause a unmatched message problem in this step.

QB-6(d)
Explain the output of the packet sniffer and why this is important
The sniffer here is very similar to QA-4 but with the plain text of heart rate string here
is encrypted by the TLS.
so the heart rate is not be stolen here.

QB-7(b)
Comment on how your “./tls_client” reacts and take a screenshot of the output
after attack
tls_client didn't receive any message and continue to print message with original rate
this is because the transcation is protect by the tls which make attack not successful.

QB-7(d)
Explain the output of the packet sniffer and why this is important
The sniffer here is very similar to QA-4 but with the plain text of heart rate string here
is encrypted by the TLS.
so the heart rate is not be stolen here.

QC-3
Comment on how your “./tls_client” reacts and take a screenshot of the output that
appears both before and after the execution, “./set_rate 1”

before the ./set_rate 1 Current settings of message is rate 3
after the ./set_rate 1 Client receive message New rate 1 received from server.
and change the current settings of rate to 1 , and speed of message changed.

QC-4
Comment on how your dual thread tls_client avoids errors that are discussed above.
In my tls_client.c for the thread function inside of 
if statement
	if(strstr(buf2, "new_rate: ") != NULL) //server receive new_rate
	I add one more line  receive_length = SSL_read(ssl, buf2, sizeof(buf2));
	after the new rate setting which fix this off by one problem(unmatched message problem)
